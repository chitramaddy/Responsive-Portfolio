            <img src="assets/Images/Beach.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

            <p>I started my career in client relations with a touch of sales/marketing here and there. After 5 years in
                client relations, moved to the US of A. Then priorities changed, visa status changed and so did life. The
                time I spent away from career got me thinking. Client relations is all fine, but I wanted much more.</p>
            <p>A career in which I can nurture my creativity; I can use my critical thinking. This combined with my awe for
                the world wide web lead me to the Rutgers Bootcamp on Web Developement. It has been a fascinating journey
                since then. 
            <p>Did I say <strong>fascinating</strong> but <strong>hectic</strong>? There is no free time, whatsoever. If I get any freetime, I would love to relax with a cup of coffee and a book.</p>
